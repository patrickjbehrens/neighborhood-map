# Neighborhood Map Project -- Front-End Web Development Nanodegree

## Description

The purpose of this project is to help users find great pet places in Berkeley, including groomers, pet stores and dog parks. Users can click on a location to discover more about each location on Foursquare. I used the Google Maps API to generate the map and the Foursquare API to render user/checkin information.

## Installation

To run the program, download the repository from https://github.com/patrickjbehrens/neighborhood-map and open the index.html file in your browser.
